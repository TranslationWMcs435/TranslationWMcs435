UIAutomator has several major limitations.

Swiping in-app has not been demonstrated yet. There is output from the parser that should work, but I haven't yet seen it
swipe something while in a test. Swipes will require (as stated elsewhere) end positions or at least distance/speed ofswipe.

It can handle some android-generated assets, but not others. If there is only one button of that description, for instance,
it'll guess right. But if there's more than one, it'll take the one first in the tree. See mileage test cases for
evidence of this failure. This is unfixable with the current content of the JSON files.

Typing requires a click on the item right beforehand. This is because the IDs may be garbled to
"id/keyboard_view" in the actual typing command.

Opening an app from the home screen may only work on a Nexus... 5 I think. The reason is that the "Apps" button may change
between versions of Android. When possible, the JSON should include an "OPEN" action with the name of the app as the text
so that UIAutomator can find the app. The process is slow, since it waits to throw an error when it can't click -- an
artifact of this being black box testing.
