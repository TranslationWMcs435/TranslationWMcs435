This file is for describing the requirements for each framework in a JSON file. It is hopefully a little useful for prioritizing
enhancements to the JSON file building system the grad students have going on.

General Requirements: 

For swipes: ATM there is not enough information to replicate a swipe with any accuracy. In order to accurately replicate a swipe,
the command must measure start location, end location, and duration, or else start, direction, and distance.

For Android-Generated icons: When the phone generates things like toolbars at the top of the screen, those objects are not
distinguished in a way we can recognize in the JSON files. For example, in mileage_swipe.txt, the index, name, etc. of the second
click is for a very vague button. We can only tell that it is the third button up top because of the pixel location, which will vary
by device.
Possible solutions: Record more of the hierarchy in JSON files (computationally complex). Or, tell us if you are using the same device
(pixels can be accurately used for location then).

UiAutomator:
Requires Action for all, since that is crucial to determining how to build the action.
To open an app, include a JSON component that has the action "OPEN" and the application name AS IT APPEARS IN THE APP MENU as the text.
Clicks: an ID is a must. Could in theory rewrite framework to parse with bounds, though it requires testing only on the same device.

Typing: an ID is optional, since the JSON files show clicks on the same place before typing starts. If that feature goes away,
there will be some trouble, since the UIAutomatorFunctions class won't know what you're trying to type on. Having a real ID
rectifies that problem.
Swipes: Start, end, duration is the default. A skeleton of swipe implementation is incoming, but it does not yet have real functionality.
